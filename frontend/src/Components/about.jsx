                                A grocery store is another form of retailing, primarily focusing on selling food, along with non-food
                                household products, such as bathroom or cleaning products, to their consumers. Generally, most grocery stores
                                will carry canned items, fish, dairy products, raw and prepared meats, baked products, fresh and frozen fruits
                                and vegetables, and many different snacks.1 Larger grocery stores, also known as supermarkets, can carry
                                non-food products, such as clothing and household items due to the immense amount of space they occupy and
                                their large profit allowing them to reach a more diverse consumer market, also allowing for consumers to find
                                all their needs in one area. Depending on their geographic concentration, grocery stores will vary in size and
                                products they will carry to fit and satisfy their consumerâ€™s needs. Some examples of grocery stores or
                                supermarket that excel in this category are Loblaws, Metro and Sobeys.
